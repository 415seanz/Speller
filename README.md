This is a program written in C. One would use dictionary.c to upload a given txt file dictionary (from the /dictionaries folder in this repository). Then, speller.c will allow the user to import some other txt file (from the /texts folder in this repository). Speller.c will check that txt file for spelling and return some statistics about the text along with any misspelled words.
